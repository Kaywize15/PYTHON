05 SOLUTIONS TO TASK GIVEN
# Total Number of Accident for each day.
This is calculated as getting the total numbers of accident that occur during the days of the week (Monday-Friday)
The total number of accident for each day can be calculated using the "Dayweek" column with the count() function:
Firstly, a new variable will be assigned (Accident), then using the Data variable name with groupby function to group the "Dayweek" column in a tuple bracket() and using the same "Dayweek" column in a list bracket[] then dot count function to count the days.
Accident=Crash.groupby("Dayweek")["Dayweek"].count()
Accident (Calling the new variable to display the solution).
Dayweek
Friday       8665
Monday       6108
Saturday     9696
Sunday       8460
Thursday     7106
Tuesday      6145
Wednesday    6663

#Average Speed for each Road User.
Getting the average speed for each Road User, the "Road User" and "Speed Limit" column will be used.
Firstly, the "Speed Limit" column has some errors in values and data types which need to be corrected before proceeding.
Replacing the strings cell in the "Speed Limit" column: The Variable used in importing the data will be assigned to the "Speed Limit" column in a list bracket[], then equals to the data variable and the "Speed Limit" column in a list bracket[] dot replace, then in a tuple bracket() we would input the strings and errors in the "Speed Limit" column to 0 passing it into a dictionary bracket{} then using the dot astype function which is integer in a list bracket(int)to end it.
Crash["Speed Limit"]=Crash["Speed Limit"].replace({"Unspecified":0,"<40":40}).astype(int)
Crash["Speed Limit"]=Crash["Speed Limit"].fillna(0) - This functions fill in empty spaces to 0 in the "Speed Limit" column.
Then, the Average Speed for each Road User will be calculated as : Assigning a new variable for the solution (Speed), then using the Data variable name with groupby function to group the "Road User" column in a tuple bracket() and using the "Speed Limit" column as a mean in a list bracket[] then dot mean function to give the average speed for the Road User.
Speed=Crash.groupby("Road User")["Speed Limit"].mean()

Firstly, the charts will be represented by a figure, then assigning a new variable to the chart (CrashData) which equals to plot dot subplots function, then in a tuple bracket() the number of rows and number of columns will be indicated which equals to the figure size(legth and breadth of the whole chart).
fig,CrashData=plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=3,figsize=(14,8))
plt.savefig("ChartPlot.png") - (This save the display chart as a jpeg or any format)
plt.show() - (This will display the image as indicated below)
![ChartPlot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f7dfe2-b331-461a-b493-1336744c764b)

Step(ii) - Giving a title to the Chart.
Firstly, the figure which is the chart dot suptitle function, then in a tuple bracket() the name of the title will be passed in as a "STRING", using the fontsize function=30 and fontsize function to be italic and also the fontweight to be bold while the color of the title is is assigned as Black using the Hex Color Codes.
fig,CrashData=plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=3,figsize=(14,8))
